# Welcome to Mobile App Architectures project

As you might have guessed, this project is going to be about mobile apps and their architectures. I am not going to describe each architecture in every possible detail, there is enough content on the web about them already. 

I am going to implement 2 simple application with each of them, instead.

This will let us understand pros and cons of each architecture in real world project.

Architectures I am going to cover are the most trending in the iOS word these days:

1. **MVC** \(Model View Controller\) or mostly known as Massive View Controller. I know, I know, it is not an app architecture, but most devs still think it is, so I am going to cover it here.
2. **VIPER **-** **
